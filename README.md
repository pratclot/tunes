# Tunes

Here are some guitar tabs I made to not forget the songs I learnt by ear and eyes.
I am a Chet Atkins fan, and I somewhat learned to play this style via tabs initially.
This repo is sort of my attempt to share what I now know to help anyone willing to learn fingerpicking.

I do not put too much effort (I am just not that good) into making the tabs sound absolutely perfect as 
their goal is to just give a player an idea what chords and shapes to do with the left hand and which strings 
to pluck with the right one. Perfecting how you play is best done by comparison with the original.

I try to always add the chord diagrams so that it is easy to get someone to play rhythm for you.

# MuseScore tips

What gets me working on a tab is the following:
- figure out how to play some parts of a song with the guitar in hands
- create new score, add a classical or a jazz guitar, use only tablature
- make rests visible by right-clicking the staff -> Staff/Part Properties -> Advanced Style Properties -> Note Values (appears if you have added a guitar tab) -> Check show rests 
- use `q` and `w` to adjust note durations, and also the numbers `4`, `5` etc
- enable swing in Format -> Style -> Score -> Swing -> Sixteenth Note
- start with the bass notes and use voice 1 for them (blue)
- once you have some 12-16 measures with the bass working, add treble notes with voice 2 (green)
- use the rests (`;`) to fill out next voice measure, typically with eights, and then place the notes
- use View -> Mixer to mute an instrument
